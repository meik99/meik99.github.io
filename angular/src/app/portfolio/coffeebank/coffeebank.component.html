      This app was created, to keep track of who bought what in
      an employee kitchen environment.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
      Employees of a firm wanted a mostly informal way to track
      credit that was built up when buying items such as a cup
      of coffee or a snack bar. The cost of such a product was
      not payed immediately after taking it, but was written
      down on a tally sheet. Miscalculation of totals
      and forgetting to write the consumption of a product
      down was common. These problems were alleviated after
      the introduction of this application.

      The first use case of this app was to enable customers
      to buy products. To achieve this, a SQLite database was
      added. The entities of which are displayed in Fig. 1.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
      To write data to the database and read from it, the Android
      library "Room" was used, which is an OR-Mapper specifically
      made for Android apps. The DAOs that were created, where
      then encapsulated in facades, which are the connecting
      classes between this database layer and other layers of
      the application.

      To let users interact with the data and buy products,
      two screens were added. One screen, as seen as in Fig. 2,
      displays every customer that is registered in the app.
      When a user clicks on a customer, the app navigates to
      the second screen, as seen as in Fig. 3, where a product
      can be bought by clicking on it. Notice that there is no form
      of authentication, as the requirement for this process  was
      to be easy and fast. Since the app is only used in a trusted environment,
      e.g. an office kitchen, no authentication is needed.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
      When a product has been bought, its price is added to the customers
      credit and its stock is decreased by one. After buying an item,
      the app navigates back to the customer selection screen. The transaction
      is then logged and saved in the database.
